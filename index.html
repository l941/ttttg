    <h3>Top 10 games made in 2020</h3>
    <p>Here is a list of the top 10 games made in 2020</p>
    <br/>

    <h1>1:Hades</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93K0nKXyfLzayNw22o_YdtDu6E8=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138421/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__1_HADES.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Supergiant Games</label>
    <p>Hades is a classic coming-of-age story drenched in Greek mythology. The game tells the tale of Zagreus, son of Hades, who is making a break from the depths of hell in an attempt to reach the surface. Zagreus will end up dying dozens of times over your quest through the game, so you get used to the agony of murder real quick.</p>
    <h1>2: Animal Crossing:New Horizons</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syFE6O7mYflv48wQ9fSe1FhfSsQ=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138411/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__2_AMAZON_CROSSING.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Nintendo</label>
    <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons exploded after it launched in March. Thanks to the disturbingly good release timing, people were looking for ways to distract themselves from the grim realities of the coronavirus pandemic as well as ways to digitally gather. New Horizons provided both of those</p>
    <h1>3: Microsoft Flight Simulator</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yTsgrodpBJtAq3REhXHNLRrGqOo=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138412/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__3_MICRO_FLIGHT.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Microsoft</label>
    <p>Of all the fanciful destinations that video games let you explore, planet Earth was one I didn’t expect to come in near the top of my 2020 list. But in a godforsaken year during which a once-in-a-century pandemic prevented us all from traveling, of course that would be the case.</p>
    <h1>4: Final Fantasy 7 Remake</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Lr2u4s_W73vJLtKrrJlcHbf2EM=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138413/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__4_FFVII_REMAKE.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Square Enix</label>
    <p>I didn’t get my hopes up watching the trailers for Final Fantasy 7 Remake. It had been so many years since I last played the original game ... so many years since I watched my Blu-ray copy of Advent Children Complete, a film that I stubbornly maintain “is good.” Could this shiny new game really have anything to add?</p>
    <h1>5: Kentucky Route Zero</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WD8hy38ackS5cJfea7s_9URQziU=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138419/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__5_KENTUCKY_ROUTE_ZERO.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Cardboard Computer</label>
    <p>Computer’s haunting point-and-click adventure is not exactly a 2020 video game. Kentucky Route Zero has five acts, the first of which was released in January 2013. So much has changed between 2013 and 2020, and Kentucky Route Zero’s snapshots of human life serve as a surreal record of the economic strife that has beset the working class in the United States since the 2008 economic recession.</p>
    <h1>6: Spider-Man: Miles Morales</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRhjmGSpq6H4t4lBlNYOeY4iepE=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138414/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__6_MILES_MORALES.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment</label>
    <p>2018’s Spider-Man was great, but it failed to establish Peter Parker’s role in the fabric of the city. Miles Morales, on the other hand, is Spanish Harlem. His story, identity, and reason for putting on the mask are all in service of the neighborhood he represents.</p>
    <h1>7: Half Life: Alyx</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_W2LiodzQgR-x9WsYdkH3w8eW0=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138415/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__7_HALF_LIFE_ALYX.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Valve</label>
    <p>Half Life: Alyx makes me frustrated. No, it’s not because it’s a virtual reality game. In fact, the VR implementation is done exquisitely. From the accommodating movement styles to the wide range of compatible headsets, I was rarely ever frustrated while playing (or wanting to play) Alyx. It’s also definitely not the gameplay: The physics system is a joy to interact with, and the firefights are some of the most intense action sequences I’ve played this year. I wasn’t even annoyed that the game was a prequel, and not just because your co-pilot Russell is one of Valve’s most endearingly written and acted characters.</p>
    <h1>8: Crusader Kings 3</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HLf9Cz_zv-v-5fczJlvrfU3yq4=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138416/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__8_CRUSADER_KINGS_3.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Paradox Development Studio</label>
    <p>Terrible kings, vengeful cousins, and medieval kingdoms — Crusader Kings 3 is a wonderfully dense game that rewards patient players. A player selects a kingdom, duchy, or region around the world during the medieval era. From there, they take control of that region’s ruler, and begin the complicated business of running a kingdom.</p>
    <h1>9: Blaseball</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd-g3MfXzE8wv1lr-KVownIKqks=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138417/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__9_BLASEBALL.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: The Game Band</label>
    <p>I am one of the many who have never particularly gotten into watching sports. I participated in athletics when I was younger, but it was never the team-based stuff people enjoy watching and talking about. My introduction to Blaseball was my friend messaging me on Steam asking, “What Blaseball team did you pick?” as if I was supposed to know what that meant, with no context. I hastily logged into the provided link and picked the Baltimore Crabs, as that’s my local team. (I’m also a Cancer, so ...) From there, things spun out of control very quickly.</p>
    <h1>10: Among Us</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imJVoN15xczeLpC1jkqjtdp2CTk=/0x0:1920x1080/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138418/jbareham_201201_ecl1050_goty_2020_top_10__10_AMONG_US.jpg">
    <br/>
    <label>Publisher: Innersloth</label>
    <p>Among Us is an incredibly simple game, yet no two rounds are the same. Up to 10 players all head into space, where a band of beans serving as crewmates on a station or ship have to work together to complete a variety of tiny tasks. The problem is that one to three of those crewmates are hidden impostors, who have the ability to sabotage the station and murder their comrades. When a player discovers a body or hits an emergency meeting button, everyone gathers together to try and uncover the truth, and it inevitably goes wrong.</p>
